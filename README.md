# Auto Webhook Spring Boot Application

## Problem Statement

Build a Spring Boot application that automatically interacts with a remote API at application startup, without any manual HTTP trigger (i.e., no controller call).

## Objective

The application must:

- Call the `/generateWebhook` endpoint on startup.
- Solve the assigned problem and store the result in a JSON file.
- Send the result to the provided webhook with JWT authentication.
